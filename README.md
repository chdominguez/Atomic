# Atomic
Modern molecular visualizer for macOS and iPadOS

:warning: | **Atomic is currently in early development.** 
To try on iPad stay tuned for an upcoming TestFlight build. For macOS, build the project on Xcode.

## Why atomic?
There are plenty of molecular visualizers out there for every platform, so, why another one? 
Usually, current molecular visualizers for macOS are old and use deprecated APIs and as a consecuence, they can suddenly crash or stop working in future OS updates.
With Atomic, a cross-platform molecular visualizer, you can use the full power of the Apple hardware, integrating native APIs such as SwiftUI or SceneKit. Hence, Atomic will always work on the most recent software.

## TODO
- [X] Update already placed atom colors as preferences change
- [ ] Change color of selection
- [ ] Work on the website
- [ ] Implement 3D structures for proteins
- [ ] Custom camera controller for iOS / Zooming
- [ ] Hide/unhide solvent for proteic systems
- [ ] Support for exporting Gaussian, Gamess... input files
- [ ] Optimize reading/rendering speed

## Contribute
Atomic is a free, open-source molecular visualizer and anybody with knwoledge of macOS, iOS, Swift or SwiftUI is welcomed to participate into the project.
