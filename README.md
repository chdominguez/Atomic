# Atomic
Modern molecular visualizer for macOS and iPadOS

:warning: | **Atomic is currently in early development.** 
To try on iPad, join the beta using the TestFlight link present in the Releases tab. For macOS, go to the releases tab and download the dmg.

## Why atomic?
There are plenty of molecular visualizers out there for every platform, so, why another one? 
Usually, current molecular visualizers for macOS are old and use deprecated APIs and as a consecuence, they can suddenly crash or stop working in future OS updates.
With Atomic, a cross-platform molecular visualizer, you can use the full power of the Apple hardware, integrating native APIs such as SwiftUI or SceneKit. Hence, Atomic will always work on the most recent software.

## TODO
- [X] Update already placed atom colors as preferences change
- [X] Change color of selection
- [X] Update icon
- [X] Revamp UI for a modern look
- [X] Implement 3D structures for proteins
- [X] Custom camera controller for iOS / Zooming
- [ ] Support for molecular dynamics simulations
- [ ] Work on the website
- [ ] Hide/unhide solvent for proteic systems
- [ ] Support for exporting Gaussian, Gamess... input files
- [ ] Optimize reading/rendering speed

## Contribute
Atomic is a free, open-source molecular visualizer and anybody with knwoledge of macOS, iOS, Swift or SwiftUI is welcomed to participate into the project.
